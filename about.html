        <p>
            We, the founders of Sectour noticed that with growth in tourism sector, there have been consistent challenges in safety and security to be addressed. Issues related to eve teasing, overcharging, duping, theft etc. have been noted at many important tourist destinations. Initiatives in the past to sensitise public have been undertaken but the challenges persist. To address these issues, we came up with this website where you get to be notified about some important details of the place.
